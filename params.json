Valid for all comparison\r\n  operators except *!=* ==\r\n* short-circuit boolean operators: && ||, && returns the right operand if\r\n  the left operand is nonzero, else zero; || returns the left operand unless\r\n  it's zero, and it's right operand if the left one is zero.\r\n* unary operators: + - ! (boolean not)\r\n* modulus operator: %\r\n* power operator _&lt;base&gt;_ ** _&lt;exp&gt;_ (right-associative)\r\n* alternate numeric format: #_rrggbb_ or #_rgb_. Useful to set the color\r\n  of the pen through the pen_color function.\r\n* turtle functions: forward, left, right, set_heading, home, clear, pen_up,\r\n  pen_down, set_color.\r\n* math functions: abs, ceil, floor, round, log, exp, sqrt, pow, min, max,\r\n  sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2\r\n* C-like assign operators: += -= *= /= %= **= ||= &&=\r\n* optimized parser using not-predicates (the sample was too slow)\r\n* corrected associativity of additive and multiplicative operators (they are\r\n  left-associative, and in the sample they are right-associative)\r\n* C-like convention regarding truth values: zero is false, anything else is\r\n  true. The boolean not operator converts 0 to 1, and nonzero to 0.\r\n* declaration and initialization through the extended syntax: var _&lt;id&gt;_ := _&lt;expr&gt;_;\r\n* custom CodeMirror-based syntax highlighter for Tortoise."}
