Assignment for lesson 6 of PL101 at http://www.nathansuniversity.com/.

Tortoise interpreter with lots of goodies:

* if (<cond>) <if_true> else <if_false>;
* return <optional_expr>;
* ternary inline-if operator: <cond> ? <if_true> : <if_false>
* ternary "chained" comparison operators: x < y < z is equivalent to
  x < y && y < z, but y is evaluated only once. Valid for all comparison
  operators except != ==
* short-circuit boolean operators: && ||, && returns the right operand if
  the left operand is nonzero, else zero; || returns the left operand unless
  it's zero, and it's right operand if the left one is zero.
* unary operators: + - ! (boolean not)
* modulus operator: %
* power operator <base> ** <exp> (right-associative)
* alternate numeric format: #rrggbb or #rgb. Useful to set the color
  of the pen through the pen_color function.
* turtle functions: forward, left, right, set_heading, home, clear, pen_up,
  pen_down, set_color.
* math functions: abs, ceil, floor, round, log, exp, sqrt, pow, min, max,
  sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2
* C-like assign operators: += -= *= /= %= **= ||= &&=
* optimized parser using not-predicates (the sample was too slow)
* corrected associativity of additive and multiplicative operators (they are
  left-associative, and in the sample they are right-associative)
* C-like convention regarding truth values: zero is false, anything else is
  true. The boolean not operator converts 0 to 1, and nonzero to 0.
* declaration and initialization through the extended syntax: var <id> := <expr>;
* custom CodeMirror-based syntax highlighter for Tortoise.
